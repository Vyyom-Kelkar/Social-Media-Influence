>Data Description
>
>The dataset, provided by Peerindex, comprises a standard, pair-wise preference learning task. Each datapoint describes two individuals. Pre-computed, standardised features based on twitter activity (such as volume of interactions, number of followers, etc) is provided for each individual.
>
>The discrete label represents a human judgement about which one of the two individuals is more influential. The goal of the challenge is to train a machine learning model which, for a pair of individuals, predicts the human judgement on who is more influential with high accuracy. Labels for the dataset have been collected by PeerIndex using an application similar to the one described in this post.
