# SocialMediaInfluence
The project idea is to compare whose influence is higher on social media between any 2 given candidates based on activity such as number of followers, number of posts, volume of interactions, responses etc. and use that to predict the more influential of any given pair of candidates.

For this purpose we will be using a data set from Kaggle.
